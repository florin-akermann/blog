### KIP-798

I authored a small [KIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-798%3A+Add+possibility+to+write+kafka+headers+in+Kafka+Console+Producer) 
for the kafka-console-producer and provided the [implementation](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11456).
It was a great experience. The community is very helpful and welcoming. I intend to contribute again.
